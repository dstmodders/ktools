## ktech

A bidirectional cross-platform converter between [Klei Entertainment][]'s TEX
texture format and PNG.

### Basic usage & examples

`ktech` converts bidirectionally between Klei's TEX format (KTEX) and PNG. If
the first argument given to `ktech` is a KTEX file, it will be converted to PNG,
and conversely, if the first argument is a PNG file it will be converted to
KTEX. If the second argument is missing, it is taken to be the first argument
with the extension replaced (but in the current directory). If the second
argument is a directory, the same is done as in the missing argument case, but
the resulting file is placed in this directory.

To convert `atlas-0.tex` to `atlas-0.png`:

```shell
$ ktech atlas-0.tex
```

To do the same, placing it in `your_directory`:

```shell
$ ktech atlas-0.tex your_directory
```

To convert `some/path/to/a.png` to `mymod/modicon.tex`:

```shell
$ ktech some/path/to/a.png mymod/modicon.tex
```

### Full usage

The following message (possibly more up to date than what is documented here)
may be obtained by entering:

```shell
$ ktech --help
```

```text
Usage: ktech [OPTION]... [--] <INPUT-PATH>... <OUTPUT-DIR>

Options for TEX input:
    -Q,  --quality  <0-100>
         Quality used when converting TEX to PNG/JPEG/etc. Higher values result
         in less compression (and thus a bigger file size). Defaults to 100.
    -i,  --info
         Prints information for a given TEX file instead of converting it.
Options for TEX output:
    --atlas  <path>
         Name of the atlas to be generated.
    -c,  --compression  <dxt1|dxt3|dxt5|rgb|rgba>
         Compression type for TEX creation. Defaults to dxt5.
    -f,  --filter  <lanczos|mitchell|bicubic|catrom|cubic|box>
         Resizing filter used for mipmap generation. Defaults to lanczos.
    -t,  --type  <1d|2d|3d|cube>
         Target texture type. Defaults to 2d.
    --no-premultiply
         Don't premultiply alpha.
    --no-mipmaps
         Don't generate mipmaps.
Other options:
    --width  <pixels>
         Fixed width to be used for the output. Without a height, preserves
         ratio.
    --height  <pixels>
         Fixed height to be used for the output. Without a width, preserves
         ratio.
    --pow2
         Rounds width and height up to a power of 2. Applied after the options
         `width' and `height', if given.
    --square
         Makes the output texture a square, by setting the width and height to
         their maximum values. Applied after the options `width', `height' and
         `pow2', if given.
    --extend
         Extends the boundaries of the image instead of resizing. Only relevant
         if either of the options `width', `height', `pow2' or `square' are
         given. Its primary use is generating save and selection screen
         portraits.
    --extend-left
         Causes the `extend' option to place the original image aligned to the
         right (filling the space on its left). Implies `extend'.
    -v,  --verbose  (accepted multiple times)
         Increases output verbosity.
    -q,  --quiet
         Disables text output. Overrides the verbosity value.
    --version
         Displays version information and exits.
    -h,  --help
         Displays usage information and exits.
    --,  --ignore_rest
         Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

If input-file is a TEX image, it is converted to a non-TEX format (defaulting
to PNG). Otherwise, it is converted to TEX. The format of input-file is
inferred from its binary contents (its magic number).

If output-path is not given, then it is taken as input-file stripped from its
directory part and with its extension replaced by `.png' (thus placing it in
the current directory). If output-path is a directory, this same rule applies,
but the resulting file is placed in it instead. If output-path is given and is
not a directory, the format of the output file is inferred from its extension.

If more than one input file is given (separated by commas), they are assumed
to be a precomputed mipmap chain (this use scenario is mostly relevant for
automated processing). This should only be used for TEX output.

If output-path contains the string '%02d', then for TEX input all its
mipmaps will be exported in a sequence of images by replacing '%02d' with
the number of the mipmap (counting from zero).
```

## krane

A cross-platform decompiler for [Klei Entertainment][]'s animation format.

`krane`'s output is a [Spriter][] project.

### Basic usage & examples

`krane`'s primary usage is converting an animation file (`anim.bin`) and a build
file (`build.bin`) as found within the ZIPs of [Don't Starve][]'s `anim/`
subdirectory into a [Spriter][] project. The simplest use case is:

```shell
$ krane anim.bin build.bin output_dir
```

Which generates a [Spriter][] project inside `output_dir`.

The last argument to `krane` is always taken to be the output directory, which
is created if it doesn't exist. All arguments before that are input files, which
should be build or anim files (directories may also be given, in which case
files called `build.bin` and `anim.bin` in them are used, provided they exist).
At least one animation file and exactly one build file must be given (multiple
build files are accepted if the `--build-name option` is given to select a
single build by build name). Atlases need not be given as arguments, since they
are determined upon inspection of the build file.

Not all of [Don't Starve][]'s animations can be faithfully represented as a
[Spriter][] project, since [Spriter][]'s animation representation is much more
restrictive than [Don't Starve][]'s native one (it doesn't support shearing, for
example). The option `--check-animation-fidelity` will check for and print the
cases where animation precision is lost.

Another use for `krane` is marking an atlas with the regions which get clipped
by the game (shading them in grey), which is meant as an aid for atlas editing.
This mode of use is triggered by the `--mark-atlases` option. When this option
is given, only a build file should be given as input (any animation files are
ignored), which is used to determine the clipping region. The shaded atlases are
placed in the output directory (the last argument), as PNG images. The following
will place the shaded atlases of `build.bin` in `output_dir`:

```shell
$ krane --mark-atlases build.bin output_dir
```

### Full usage

The following message (possibly more up to date than what is documented here)
may be obtained by entering:

```shell
$ krane --help
```

```text
Usage: krane [OPTION]... [--] <INPUT-PATH>... <OUTPUT-DIR>

Options filtering input selection:
    --build  <build name>
         Selects only a build with the given name.
    --bank  <bank name>  (accepted multiple times)
         Selects only animations in the given banks.
Options controlling the output mode:
    --mark-atlases
         Instead of performing any conversion, saves the atlases in the
         specified build as PNG, with their clipped regions shaded grey.
Options for scml output:
    --check-animation-fidelity
         Checks if the Spriter representation of the animations is faithful to
         the source animations.
Other options:
    --rename-build  <build name>
         Renames the input build to the given name.
    --rename-bank  <bank name>
         Renames the input banks to the given name.
    -v,  --verbose  (accepted multiple times)
         Increases output verbosity.
    -q,  --quiet
         Disables text output. Overrides the verbosity value.
    --version
         Displays version information and exits.
    -h,  --help
         Displays usage information and exits.
    --,  --ignore_rest
         Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

Converts the INPUT-PATH(s) into a Spriter project, placed in the directory
OUTPUT-DIR, which is created if it doesn't exist.

Whenever an INPUT-PATH is a directory, the files build.bin and anim.bin in
it (if any) are used, otherwise INPUT-PATH itself is used. The location of
build atlases is automatically determined from the build file, so they need
not be given as arguments.
```

## Docker

If you are familiar with [Docker][] you can use the corresponding [Docker Hub][]
images: https://hub.docker.com/r/dstmodders/ktools

```shell
$ cd <your data directory>
$ docker pull dstmodders/ktools
$ docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data/" dstmodders/ktools ktech --version
```

To learn more, consider checking out the
following [Usage](https://github.com/dstmodders/docker-ktools#usage) section.

## INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE

The library [libzip][] is an optional dependency. If it is present and found at
compilation time, zip archives are treated in the same manner as directories
when given as input.

### Linux

Example for the fresh instance of the latest Debian "bullseye" release.

#### 1. Install dependencies

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpng-dev libreadline-dev libzip-dev
```

#### 2. Build & install [ImageMagick][]

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install wget
$ export IMAGEMAGICK_VERSION='7.1.0-37'
$ wget -P /tmp/ "https://imagemagick.org/archive/releases/ImageMagick-${IMAGEMAGICK_VERSION}.tar.xz"
$ tar xf "/tmp/ImageMagick-${IMAGEMAGICK_VERSION}.tar.xz" -C /tmp/
$ cd /tmp/ImageMagick-${IMAGEMAGICK_VERSION}/
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib/
```

#### 3. Build & install `ktools`

```shell
$ cd /path/to/ktools
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```

If for some reason there was an issue in finding an [ImageMagick][] library, you
can point [CMake][] to it manually:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config
$ cmake \
    -DImageMagick_Magick++_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir Magick++)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname Magick++).so" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickCore_INCLUDE_DIR="$(pkg-config --cflags-only-I MagickCore | tail -c+3)" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickCore_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir MagickCore)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname MagickCore).so" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickWand_INCLUDE_DIR="$(pkg-config --cflags-only-I MagickWand | tail -c+3)" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickWand_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir MagickWand)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname MagickWand).so" \
  .
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```

### macOS

#### 1. Install [ImageMagick][]

If you have [Homebrew][] installed:

```shell
$ brew install imagemagick
```

Otherwise, download and build [ImageMagick][] manually. You may use
[Linux 2nd step](#linux) as an example.

#### 2. Build & install `ktools`

```shell
$ cd /path/to/ktools
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```

If for some reason there was an issue in finding an [ImageMagick][] library, you
can point [CMake][] to it manually:

```shell
$ brew install pkg-config
$ cmake \
    -DImageMagick_Magick++_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir Magick++)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname Magick++).dylib" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickCore_INCLUDE_DIR="$(pkg-config --cflags-only-I MagickCore | tail -c+3)" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickCore_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir MagickCore)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname MagickCore).dylib" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickWand_INCLUDE_DIR="$(pkg-config --cflags-only-I MagickWand | tail -c+3)" \
    -DImageMagick_MagickWand_LIBRARY="$(pkg-config --variable=libdir MagickWand)/lib$(pkg-config --variable=libname MagickWand).dylib" \
  .
$ ./configure && make
$ sudo make install
```

### Windows

Open [CMake][], select the `ktools` directory as the source folder ("Where is
the source code") and whichever directory you'd like as the build folder ("Where
to build the binaries"). Click "Configure" and select a generator (typically
either a version of Visual Studio or "MinGW Makefiles"). Leave "Use default
native compilers" checked and click "Finish". If you wish to customize some
compilation option (which shouldn't be necessary) do so now, in the options
presented in red after the configure step finishes. If any option was changed,
click "Configure" again. Finally, click "Generate", which should place the
project files in the build directory you selected.

For MinGW, proceed as in the Linux/macOS case (i.e., simply run `make` in the
build directory).

For Visual Studio, open the `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` file, right-click the `ktools`
solution on the left pane, click on "Configuration Manager..." and make sure to
select "Release" as the active solution configuration. Then build the solution
(which may be done by pressing "F7").
